Numpy Tutorial
==============

This section of the tutorial is the most hands off.
The point of this section is to give a practical example that you may face.
Hopefully, as you solve the problem, you find yourself more aware of the tools you are using.

Take your time and try to come up with a way to read in the xyz file and then find the shortest distance
between any two atoms in the molecule. At the very end, I will show two separate solutions.

Go!
